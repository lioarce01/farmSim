# ðŸŒ± Farm Simulator

Farm Simulator is an engaging farming application where users can plant seeds, water them, and harvest their crops. Each plant has unique characteristics such as rarity and rewards based on the type of plant and its rarity. The application features real-time updates, weather tracking, and a user-friendly interface that enhances the farming experience.
